# Intro

Rust [Actix web framework](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) serving static [solidjs](https://github.com/solidjs/) files built by [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). By no means it is ready for anything, I only wanted to know I could not if I should.

I call it "Rusty Solid" which incidentally would be my adult performer name.

## Why

I don't know. Wanted to try actix web I guess. I've also never written a line of Solidjs before .. which you can tell by the commit history.

Btw can we all appreciate how sick the js bundle size is, I'm sure that means the website is `Blazingly fast`.

## What

There is a button that you can click to call and it calls https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for fake user data served by a route in our rusty server ... that's it.

### TODO's

[] - add some type of cargo to build ui before each `cargo run` and watch files
[] - anything to do with a real project or production

I'm not going to do any of these.
